# Blitz App Adblock

A simple and quick patcher that blocks ads/trackers on the Blitz.gg desktop application (supports Mac and Windows).

If Blitz.gg updates, you will need to rerun the program to reapply the patch. 

If there are issues after an update, [submit a Github issue](https://github.com/lulzsun/blitz-app-adblock/issues/new) and attach useful information such as error messages.

You can uninstall the adblocker by uninstalling Blitz.
